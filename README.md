# This project is to test various accessibility practices, and to provide additional accessibility options for commonly used tools such as boot strap.

### Currently the following issues have been addressed as far boot strap and or accessibility:
1. Bootstrap's contrast issue with its default color values.
2. Additional button sizes for larger button sizes.
3. Increased font sizes for body, paragraphs.
4. A More universal color palette which better supports designing for color blindness and readability and contrast with color blindness.

### Currently planned issues to test and address:
1. Better Audio and visual feedback testing for website design.
